    D2R Runewords will be imported to Path of Diablo (with changes) in an effort to both increase item diversity and prevent players from accidentally wasting their runes when making them. * * When the season is over we can decide if each one should leave or stay. Some of them have weak designs behind them because I want more time to rework them. In the meantime, they have been introduced in a weaker state as placeholder.
